As a software engineer
I want to split CachingClient into per data type clients, with only core behaviour remaining in CachingClient 
So that each data type specific CachingClient is easier to test and mock independently of the others

Given there is already CachingClient impl for each data type
When breaking CachingClient down
Then use the split lines provided by the file name convention
And create a new struct for each data type, e.g. PointerCachingClient for pointer_caching_client.rs
And create a new() function for each with only the dependencies needed for the per data type CachingClient
And all CachingClient impls are contained within /src/client, including archive_caching_client.rs, caching_client.rs, chunk_caching_client.rs, graph_entry_caching_client.rs, pointer_caching_client.rs, public_archive_caching_client.rs, public_data_caching_client.rs, register_caching_client.rs, scratchpad_caching_client.rs and tarchive_caching_client.rs

Given there is common functionality already in CachingClient
When breaking CachingClient down
Then leave all behaviour contained within caching_client.rs unchanged as CachingClient impl
And inject this reduced CachingClient struct into the newly created per data type CachingClients, e.g. PointerCachingClient 

Given CachingClient is a dependency for a number other structs
When breaking CachingClient down
Then ensure the correct new per data CachingClient (depending on methods used) and include additional per data CachingClients where necessary to provide all the methods needed

Provide unit tests where applicable for new code.

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
