As an archive API consumer
I want to be able to push tarchives to a target store-type
So that the archive API has full support for both public archives and archives

Given public_archive_service.rs already implements push_public_archive
When adding push support for tarchives
Then add push_tarchive function to tarchive_service.rs with the same signature as public_archive_service.rs
And call public_data_service.push_public_data() to push the data

Given tarchive_controller.rs already calls public_data_service.push_public_data directly
When adding push support to tarchive_service.rs
Then update tarchive_controller.rs to call push_tarchive in tarchive_service.rs instead
And use tarchive_controller.rs push_archive as an example of how to call public_data_service.push_public_data 

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
