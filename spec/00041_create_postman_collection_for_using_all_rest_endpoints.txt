As a software engineer
I want to add a Postman Collection for all REST endpoints
So that it is simple to test all API endpoints

Given the postman collection needs to be stored in a directory
When adding the postman collection
Then place all the files in the /test/postman directory
And call the collection anttp_postman_collection.json

Given postman collections can be split into directories
When adding the postman collection
Then place REST in a folder to allow other protocols to be added later

Given most of the files in /src/controller directory are REST controllers
When adding REST endpoints to the postman collection
Then ensure all endpoints with utoipa annotations are added

Given postman collections can store responses as environment variables
When adding requests that return responses that are used by get requests
Then ensure these response variables are stored in environment variables

Implementation Notes

- Use a {base_url} environtment variable to store the hostname and default to http://localhost:18888 for REST
- Use the {base_url} for all requests
- Test the postman collection works by calling the requests with &#39;newman&#39; (command line)
- Store requests in create, update, get, delete order where applicable, allowing newman to execute in order for basic testing
- Use &#39;memory&#39; as the store_type 
- add /test/postman/README.md documenting what the postman collection provides and how to run the collection with newman
