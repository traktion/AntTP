As an API consumer
I want to be able to get PNRs
So that I can view the current state of the PNR zones

Given pnr_service.rs is responsible for managing PNRs
When getting a PNR
Then use get_pointer in pointer_service.rs as an example
And use update_pnr in pnr_service.rs as an example
And accept a name as a parameter to lookup the resolver_address
And use the resolve_address target to lookup the PNR zone chunk
And then return the PNR zone chunk as a PnrZone
And refactor update_pnr to share the same function to resolve the PNR zone from the name

Given pnr_controller.rs handles REST request for PNRs
When updating pnr_service.rs
Then also update pnr_controller.rs to reflect the new GET operation
And use put_pnr in pnr_controller.rs as an example
And use URL format GET /anttp-0/pnr/{name} where name is the PNR name used to define the resolver address

Given /lib.rs is responsible for integrating REST controllers
When updating pnr_controller.rs
Then also update /lib.rs to reflect the new GET operation
And place the new get_pnr function within the primary section where uploads_disabled can be true or false
And update openapi paths to include get_pnr

Given the postman collection reflects the REST endpoints
When updating pnr_controller.rs
Then also update the postman collection to reflect the new GET operation
And ensure it is added directly after the create and put operations
And update the associated /test/postman/README.md
And use newman to confirm both the collection and the new put_pnr endpoint work as expected

Provide unit tests where applicable for new code.

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
