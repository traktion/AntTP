As a REST API consumer
I want to be able to resolve a source name or address from a resolver endpoint
So that I can easily discover a target address without knowing additional details about the source name/address

Given pointer_controller.rs already exist and define a similar pattern
When adding the resolver REST endpoint
Then add /src/controller/resolver_controller.rs based on /scr/controller/pointer_controller.rs
And only add a function called 'resolve' similar to the get_pointer function, but without the PointerError requirement
And the endpoint should be GET /anttp-0/resolve/{name}, where {name} can be a source name or address
And the endpoint will only return a successful 200 response with the resolved target address or a 404 if it could not be found
And update the utoipa annotation to reflect the above

Given resolver_service.rs only returns a string as a response
When adding the resolver endpoint
Then create a new Resolve struct in /src/model/resolve.rs (defined below)
And add resolve_name_item in resolver_service.rs, which calls resolve_name, but returns 'Option', populating Resolve.name=name (passed in) and Resolve.content=resolved_address.address.
And update resolver_controller.rs to return body = Resolve instead of String (for utopia annotation).

```
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, ToSchema)]
pub struct Resolve {
    pub name: String,
    pub content: String,
}
```

Given the 'resolve_name_item' function in resolver_service.rs can accept any source name or address as an input and output Resolve instance
When adding the resolver endpoint
Then ensure the 'resolve' function in resolve_controller.rs accepts `resolver_service: Data` as an argument
And calls the 'resolve_name_item' function in resolver_service.rs and attempt to resolve the address
And returns the Resolve instance containing the source name and target address to the consumer
And update /src/lib.rs utoipa annotation to include the new controller and endpoint
And add a route to resolve in resolver_controller.rs

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00149_issue_title.txt)
- Update unit tests to reflect the above
