As an MCP tool API consumer
I want to be able to update PNRs
So that I can edit the current state of the PNR zones

Given pnr_handler.rs handles MCP tool request for PNRs
When adding update PNR support
Then update pnr_handler.rs to include a update_pnr_zone function
And use pointer_handler.rs as a reference

Given pnr_service.rs implements update_pnr
When adding update PNR support
Then call update_pnr in a similar way to pnr_controller.rs

Given gRPC requires protobuffer definitions
When adding update PNR support
Then update gRPC service definition for update PNR zone request/response messages in /proto/pnr.proto

Given gRPC needs to be integrated with Tonic server
When adding update PNR gRPC endpoint
Then update build.rs to include pnr.proto changes

Provide unit tests where applicable for new code.
