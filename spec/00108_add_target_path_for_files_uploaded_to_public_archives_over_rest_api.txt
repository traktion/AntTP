As a software engineer
I want to provide a target path (for each file) when uploading files to public archive via REST API
So that I can more easily update more complex public archives with file tree structures

Given both POST and PUT to /anttp-0/multipart/public_archive are already supported
When choosing to upload one or more files
Then accept an optional target-path field with each file, which accepts a relative target path
And the target-path should be sanitised to avoid any dangerous directory traversals

Given public_archive_service.rs has a function update_archive() for uploading data as public archives
When new files are uploaded
Then when preparing the archive using temporary files, then ensure the directory structure reflects target-path (relative to base directory) 
Then when public_archive.add_file() is called, provide the target-path with the file name, to create the file at the correct location, using the temporary directory structure as a guide

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Integrate support with MCP tools and gRPC if necessary
- Ensure paths are sanitised to avoid security vulnerabilities, especially during upload to the temporary directory
