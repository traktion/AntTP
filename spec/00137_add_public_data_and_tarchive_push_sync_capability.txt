As a public data uploader
I want to be able to push public data from memory/disk cache to network
So that data staged in the disk cache can be synced to the target store-type (default to 'network')

Given public_archive_controller.rs has a push_public_archive function which pushes an archive to a different store-type
When pushing public data from the memory to disk, from memory to network, or from disk to network
Then use public_archive_controller as an example to create push_public_data function in public_data_controller.rs
And use POST `/anttp-0/public_data/{address}` as the new endpoint

Given public data is data with a datamap at a single address
When pushing public data from the cache to the network
Then the implementation is much simpler
And only the public data at the resolved address must be pushed to the target store-type
And there are no archive files to iterate through or upload

Given public_archive_service.rs contains push_public_archive function which contains the core logic to push/sync data
When pushing public data to a new target-store type
Then use public_archive_service.rs as an example to create push_public_data function
And only get the public data with the client (self.public_data_caching_client.data_get_public)
And push to the target store-type with the client (self.public_data_caching_client.data_put_public)

Given tarchive_controller.rs has tarchive endpoints and a tarchive is essentially public data (a tar file)
When adding push/sync support to public_data_controller.rs
Then also add an endpoint to tarchive_controller.rs, which calls public_data_service.rs in the same was as public_data_controller.rs does
And use POST `/anttp-0/tarchive/{address}` as the new endpoint

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- The order of permanence for store-type is 'memory -> disk -> network' with network being the most permanent
- Target store-type must be more permanent than the source store-type
