As a pubilc archive REST API consumer
I want to provide the target path (directory) for an uploaded file as part of the 'path' in the URL
So that it is easier to place a new file within the archive

Given GET /anttp-0/public_archive/{address}/{*path} endpoint is already supported in public_archive_controller.rs
When POST or PUT files via the REST API
Then use public_archive_controller.rs get_public_archive_root and get_public_archive as an examples
And replace the target_path array (which is per upload) with the shared {path:*} variable containing a target path/directory for all uploads

Given a {*path} can only be a directory
When the path is not a directory
Then return a validation error from public_archive_service.rs (using appropriate errors for the struct)

Given the response to create or update a public archive should return a similar response to POST or GET requests
When there is a POST or PUT operation
Then return the same payload as a GET /anttp-0/public_archive/{address}/{*path} request (see example JSON below)
And items and address should be populated, to reflect the files PUT/POSTed and the address of the archive, respectively.

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Do not attempt to clone or mock *_service.rs code

Example JSNON responses for file:

```
{
  "items": [
    "file.txt",
    "file2.txt"
  ],
  "content": "",
  "address": "{address}"
}
```
