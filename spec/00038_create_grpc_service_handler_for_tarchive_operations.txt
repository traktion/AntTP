As a software engineer
I want to add a gRPC endpoint for tarchive
So that tarchive scan be created using third party gRPC clients

Given tarchive_controller.rs and scratchpad_service.rs exist
When adding tarchive_handler.rs
Then it should reflect tarchive_controller.rs
And be added to a new &#39;grpc&#39; module under the root as grpc/tarchive_handler.rs

Given gRPC requires protobuffer definitions
When adding tarchive gRPC endpoints
Then create gRPC service definition for tarchive request/response messages in /proto/tarchive.proto and share File type between /proto/public_archive.proto and /proto/tarchive.proto

Given gRPC needs to be integrated with Tonic server
When adding tarchive gRPC endpoins
Then update lib.rs to integrate the gRPC tarchive_handler.rs

Given /grpc/public_archive_handler.rs already exists
When adding the tarchive_handler.rs
Then use public_archive_handler.rs as an example

Provide unit tests where applicable to grpc/tarchive_handler.rs and related new code.

Implementation Notes

- Assume other handlers will be added in the future, following the same pattern, in /grpc directory/module
- Define From traits to perform mapping between structs, including errors (use ?)
- Use Actix Data instead of Arc
- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
