Add get and list files support to tarchive REST API

As a software engineer
I want to provide a GET endpoint for tarchive via REST API
So that I can list files in a tarchive

Given GET and LIST endpoints are already supported for public archives (in public_archive_controller.rs and public_archive_service.rs)
When adding get/list endpoints for tarchives
Then use these files as an example
And use GET `/anttp-0/tarchive/{address}` and GET `/anttp-0/tarchive/{address}/{path}` as endpoints for tarchives
And use tarchive_caching_client.get_archive_from_tar to download the bytes for the tar index
And Archive::build_from_tar should be used instead of Archive::build_from_public_archive
And self.public_data_caching_client.data_put_public should be used instead of self.public_archive_caching_client.archive_get_public, as tarchives are essentially public data (tar files)

Given tarchives are an indexed tar file and an offset and a size is needed to retrieve the correct data segment
When downloading a single file from a tarchive
Then FileService.download_data_bytes(data_address, offset, size) function must be called to retrieve the correct data

Given public archive and tarchive will share some code
When adding making the changes
Then update the plan to refactor PublicArchiveResponse to be called ArchiveResponse and PublicArchiveRaw to be ArchiveRaw.

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Integrate support with MCP tools and gRPC if necessary
- Do not attempt to clone or mock other *_service.rs code
- Mock TArchiveCachingClient using mockall `!mock` annotation to enable testing
