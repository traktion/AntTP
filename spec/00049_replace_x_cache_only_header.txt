As a REST API consumer
I want to provide x-store-type header instead of x-cache-only
So that it is more logical and is consistent with the service layer and other API endpoints

Given x-cache-only header is currently used
When x-store-type header is used instead
Then all controller code in /src/controller that uses x-cache-only must be updated to use x-store-type
And this includes variable names
And this includes utoipa annotations

Given the postman collection currently uses x-cache-only
When the header is renamed to x-store-type
Then the postman collection must be updated to reflect the change in header name
And newman must be executed to verify the change

Given documentation currently uses x-cache-only
When the header is renamed to x-store-type
Then the documentation (in .md files) must be updated to reflect the change in header name

Provide unit tests where applicable for new code.

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
