Update Public Archive and Tarchive REST endpoints to return PathDetails in 'items' instead of filename strings

As a public archive and tarchive API consumer
I want to see the meta data associated with the item, including name, date modified, size and type
So that it is easier to understand more detail about the files in the archive

Given path_detail.rs contains PathDetail which includes all file/directory meta data
When a public archive or tarcdive API is called (REST, MCP or gRPC)
Then PublicArchiveResponse returns items as a Vec instead of Vec
And public_archive_controller.rs and tarchive_controller.rs are updated to reflect the changes

Given gRPC will require a proto change to reflect the new data
When updating gRPC endpoints
Then update the public_archive.proto responses to return define an Item message, which includes name (PathDetail.display), modified (PathDetail.modified), size ((PathDetail.size) and type ((PathDetail.path_type)
And an example proto is at the bottom of this issue.

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Do not attempt to clone or mock *_service.rs code
- Update postman collection and run newman to validate the changes

Example proto response (where the types are the best type to reflect the data):

```
message Item {
  name = 1;
  modified = 2;
  size = 3;
  type = 4; 
}
```
