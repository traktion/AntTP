Create a public archive endpoint to sync a local archive to the network

As a public archive API user
I want to be able to push local (cached) changes to Autonomi network
So that I can use the cache as a staging area, then sync to the network when the archive is ready to share

Given a public archive can be staged in disk or memory cache by posting with store-type disk or memory
When the archive is ready to be persisted to the network
Then it a new endpoint should be created which retrieves the archive from cache and uploads it to the network
And the endpoint should be POST /anttp-0/public_archive/{address} in public_archive_controller.rs for REST
And the function should be push_public_archive in public_archive_handler.rs for gRPC (in a similar style to other functions in the struct)
And the function should be push_public_archive in public_archive_tool.rs for MCP (in a similar style to other functions in the struct)

Given a public archive can be retrieved from the cache using public_archive_caching_client.archive_get_public()
And can be persisted to the network public_archive_caching_client.archive_put_public() with store-type = network
When the archive is persisted to the network
Then public_archive_service.push_public_archive should be created which retrieves the archive (from cache) and puts it to the network

Given an archive could be pushed from memory to disk, from memory to network, or disk to network
When pushing an archive
Then let store-type dictate the target, with the default remaining 'network'

Given gRPC will require an updated proto file
When adding the new push_public_archive function
Then also add PushPublicArchiveRequest, which takes an address
And return PublicArchiveResponse in a similar style to CreatePublicArchiveRequest
And see the example proto below

Given tarchives may share the same code being changed
When updating public archive code
Then if the code is shared, then update tarchive to keep them aligned

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Update public_archive_service.rs unit tests

message PushPublicArchiveRequest {
  string address = 1;
  optional string store_type = 2;
}
