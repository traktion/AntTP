As a software engineer
I want to provide a DELETE endpoint for public archive via REST API
So that I can remove files at a target path from the archive

Given GET /anttp-0/public_archive/{address}/{*path} is already supported
When deleting one or more files
Then add a DELETE endpoint at /anttp-0/public_archive/{address}/{*path} which accepts a address (of archive) and path for the directory/file as part of the URL

Given DELETE can be called with an address and a path
When delete is called
Then call truncate_public_archive function which gets the existing public archive, stores the files to a temporary location,   removes the file set to be deleted, then calls PublicArchiveService.update_archive() to rebuild a new archive (omitting deleted file at path)
And if the path is a directory, then remove all files within that directory from the archive
And return the new address of the new public archive 

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Integrate support with MCP tools and gRPC where appropriate, using established patterns for similar functions
- Do not attempt to clone or mock other *_service.rs code
- Mock PublicArchiveCachingClient using mockall !mock annotation to improve testing of public_archive_service.rs
- Update utoipa annotations in /src/lib to include new endpoint in where actix_config.uploads_disabled = false
- Update postman collection and run newman tests

Example JSON response for new archive after file has been deleted:

```
{
  "files": [
    "file.txt",
    "file2.txt"
  ],
  "content": "",
  "address": "{address}"
}
```
