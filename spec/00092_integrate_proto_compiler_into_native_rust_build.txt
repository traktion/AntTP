As an application user
I want cargo build to either create proto structs without having to depend on the external 'proto-compiler' command or disabled gRPC at compile time
So that the build process has no external system dependencies

Given gRPC support is not critical to core functionality
When proto files cannot be compiled due to a lack of native or external (protoc) compiler
Then annotate the code to not build with gRPC support
And allow the application to build and execute without errors

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
