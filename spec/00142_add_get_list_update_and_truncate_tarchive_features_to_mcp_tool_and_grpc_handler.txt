As an MCP tool or gRPC handler user
I want to be able to get, list, update and truncate tarchives using MCP/gRPC
So that I can have the same API feature set as the tarchive REST API

Given tarchive_service.rs supports get, list, update and truncate operations
When adding get, list, update and truncate support to tarchive_tool.rs and tarchive_handler.rs
Then use these existing service functions to implement the functionality

Given public_archive_tool.rs, public_archive_handler.rs and public_archive.proto already exist and implement similar functionality for public archives
When adding get, list, update and truncate support to tarchive_tool.rs, tarchive_handler.rs and tarchive.proto
Then use these existing code files as examples

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
