As a key value REST endpoint consumer
I want to be call key/value binary endpoints which accept/return raw binary
So that I can easily embed binary responses without having to parse JSON or base64 decode
And easily submit binary data directly 

Given key_value_controller.rs already exists and supports the non-binary GET /anttp-0/key_value/{bucket}/{object} endpoint
When adding the binary GET endpoint
Then add GET /anttp-0/binary/key_value/{bucket}/{object} endpoint which returns the raw binary data as 'application/octet-stream' instead of a JSON document
And see chunk_controller.rs and chunk_service.rs as examples for GET /anttp-0/binary/chunk/{address}

Given key_value_controller.rs already exists and supports the non-binary POST /anttp-0/key_value endpoint
When adding the binary POST endpoint
Then add POST /anttp-0/binary/key_value/{bucket}/{object} endpoint which accepts raw binary as 'application/octet-stream' data instead of a JSON document
And see chunk_controller.rs and chunk_service.rs as examples for POST /anttp-0/binary/chunk and GET /anttp-0/binary/chunk/{address}

Given key_value_controller.rs already exists and supports the non-binary POST /anttp-0/key_value endpoint
When adding the binary POST endpoint
Then change the endpoint of POST /anttp-0/key_value to POST /anttp-0/key_value/{bucket}/{object} to be consistent with the binary POST version and GET endpoint path

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00178_add_a_binary_rest_endpoints_for_key_value.txt)
- Update unit tests to validate the changes
- Update newman tests to reflect the changes
