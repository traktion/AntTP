As a software engineer
I want to add an MCP tool for tarchive
So that tarchive can be created using third party MCP clients

Given tarchive_controller.rs and tarchive_service.rs exist
When adding tarchive_handler.rs
Then it should reflect tarchive_controller.rs
And be added to a new &#39;tool&#39; module under the root as /src/tool/tarchive_tool.rs

Given /src/tool/public_archive_tool.rs already exists
When adding the tarchive_tool.rs
Then use public_archive_tool.rs as an example

Provide unit tests where applicable to /src/tool/tarchive_tool.rs and related new code.

Implementation Notes

- Assume other MCP tools will be added in the future, following the same pattern, in /src/tool directory/module
- Define From traits to perform mapping between structs, including errors (use ?)
- Use Actix Data instead of Arc
- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
