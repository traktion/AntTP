As a software engineer
I want an option to disable MCP tools
So that anttp can be customized for specific use cases

Given anttp_config.rs is responsible for managing configuration options
When adding mcp_tools_disabled option
Then add a boolean option similar to uploads_disabled
And use similar annotations, but with short argument only
And default to false
And log the argument value like uploads_disabled

Given /src/lib.rs is responsible for enabling/disabling MCP tools
When adding mcp_tools_disabled option
Then add use this anttp_config value to control whether MCP tools are enabled or disabled
And combine with a checking if uploads disabled is fals, as there are currently write operations

Provide unit tests where applicable for new code.

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00044_issue_title.txt)
