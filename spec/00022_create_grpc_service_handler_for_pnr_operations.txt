As a software engineer
I want to add a gRPC endpoint for PNR
So that PNR can be created using third party gRPC clients

Given pnr_controller.rs and pnr_service.rs exist
When adding pnr_handler.rs
Then it should reflect pnr_controller.rs
And be added to a new &#39;grpc&#39; module under the root as grpc/pnr_handler.rs

Given gRPC requires protobuffer definitions
When adding pointer gRPC endpoints
Then create gRPC service definition for pnr request/response messages in /proto/pnr.proto

Given gRPC needs to be integrated with Tonic server
When adding pnr gRPC endpoins
Then update lib.rs to integrate the gRPC pnr handler

Given there is a gRPC handler for pointers in /grpc/pointer_handler.rs
When adding the pnr_handler.rs
Then use pnr_handler.rs as an example

Provide unit tests where applicable to grpc/pnr_handler.rs and related new code.

Implementation Notes

- Assume other handlers will be added in the future, following the same pattern, in /grpc directory/module
- Define From traits to perform mapping between structs, including errors (use ?)
- Use Actix Data instead of Arc
- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
