As a software engineer
I want to validate that new builds function as expected
So that quality assurance can be improved

Given there is an existing workflow in .github/workflows/rust.yml
When a new commit is pushed to github
Then after the application is built, newman should be run against the application
And confirm that newman exists with a status code of 0

Given newman and npm will not be installed by the build workflow
When adding newman
Then add a step to install npm
And a step to install newman using npm

Given the build workflow includes several architectures
When adding newman
Then only run newman on linux x64 to reduce execution time

Given newman needs to run a collection
When newman is executed
Then use the collection located at /test/postman/anttp.postman_collection.json
