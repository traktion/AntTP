As an application user
I want to run cargo install anttp without getting "could not find streamable_http_server in transport" during the build process
So that building from source is simple

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- This issue could not be replicated, but likely relates to features on the rmcp library (e.g. transport-streamable-http-server)

Full error message:
