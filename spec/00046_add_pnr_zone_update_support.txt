As an API consumer
I want to be able to update PNRs
So the default target address can be changed
And additional sub names can be added or changed
And TTLs can be changed
And record types can be changed

Given pnr_service.rs is responsible for managing PNRs
When editing a PNR
Then use update_pointer in pointer_service.rs as an example
And ignore resolver_address, personal_address and name in the PnrZone payload
And derive the resolver_address from the name in the path
And derive the personal_address from looking up the target of the resolver_address pointer (get_pointer_target)
And return Pointer::Update error if there are issues

Given PNR zones are made up of multiple records and address
When editing a PNR zone
Then update or add PnrRecords depending on the operation
And persist the derived resolver_address and personal_address 

Given the updated PNR zone will be saved to a new chunk at a new address
When a new PNR zone chunk has been uploaded
Then the personal_pointer must also be updated to point to the new chunk

Given pnr_controller.rs handles REST request for PNRs
When updating pnr_service.rs
Then also update pnr_controller.rs to reflect the new update operation
And use put_pointer in pointer_controller.rs as an example
And use URL format PUT /anttp-0/pnr/{name} where name is the PNR name used to define the resolver address

Given /lib.rs is responsible for integrating REST controllers
When updating pnr_controller.rs
Then also update /lib.rs to reflect the new update operation
And place the new put_pnr function within the section where uploads_disabled is false

Given the postman collection reflects the REST endpoints
When updating pnr_controller.rs
Then also update the postman collection to reflect the new update operation
And ensure it is added directly after the create/put operation
And update the associated /test/postman/README.md
And use newman to confirm both the collection and the new put_pnr endpoint work as expected

Provide unit tests where applicable for new code.
