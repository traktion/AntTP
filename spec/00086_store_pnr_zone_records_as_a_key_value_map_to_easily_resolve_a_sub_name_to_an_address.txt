As a software engineer
I want to store PnrZone records as a key/value map to easily resolve a sub name to an address
So that I can have confidence that changes won't break existing functionality

Given that resolving a sub-name to an address will be a common operation
When storing and retrieving PnrZone records
Then the key to the PnrRecord should be the sub-name
And the sub-name should be removed from the PnrRecord

Given the postman collection has tests for PNR create/update
When the records value is changed to a map
Then the postman collection should be updated
And newman should be used to validate

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- PnrZone.records should use type HashMap

Example new JSON:

```
{
  "name": "testname",
  "records": {
    "": {
      "address": "a33082163be512fb471a1cca385332b32c19917deec3989a97e100d827f97baf",
      "record_type": "X",
      "ttl": 60
    },
    "subname2": {
      "address": "b33082163be512fb471a1cca385332b32c19917deec3989a97e100d827f97baf",
      "record_type": "A",
      "ttl": 30
    }
  },
  "resolver_address":null,
  "personal_address":null
}
```
