As a software engineer
I want to provide a DELETE endpoint for tarchive via REST API
So that I can remove files at a target path from the tarchive

Given GET /anttp-0/tarchive/{address}/{*path} is already supported
When deleting one or more files
Then add a DELETE endpoint at /anttp-0/tarchive/{address}/{*path} which accepts a address (of tarchive) and path for the directory/file as part of the URL

Given DELETE can be called with an address and a path
When delete is called
Then call truncate_tarchive function which gets the existing tarchive, stores the files to a temporary location, removes the file set to be deleted, then calls TArchiveService.update_tarchive() to rebuild a new tarchive (omitting deleted file at path)
And if the path is a directory, then remove all files within that directory from the archive
And return the new address of the new public archive

Given public_archive_controller.rs with delete_public_archive function already exist,
and public_archive_service.rs with truncate_public_archive function already exist,
and public_archive.proto already exist,
When adding tarchive equivalents for DELETE
Then use these public archive files and functions as an example

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Integrate support with MCP tools and gRPC where appropriate, using established patterns for similar functions
- Do not attempt to clone or mock other *_service.rs code
- Mock TArchiveCachingClient using mockall !mock annotation to improve testing of tarchive_service.rs
- Update swagger documentation for the new endpoint
- Update get_tarchive_binary in tarchive_service.rs to call tarchive_caching_client.get_archive_from_tar instead of public_data_service.get_public_data_binary, so that only the tar index is retrieved to build the archive from tar.
