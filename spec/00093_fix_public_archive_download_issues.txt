As an application user
I want to be able to view directories and files from public archives without seeing corrupted binary responses
So that public archives can be used again in a similar way to tarchives

Given it is necessary to view public archive directories and files
When accessing these items
Then AntTP should not serve raw, unexpected, binary data
And AntTP should serve the correct directories or files as expected
And the behaviour should return to functioning like in older autonomi library releases

Given corrupted public archive listings/files occur with both new and old uploads using the ant CLI tool or the POST /anttp-0/multipart/public_archive REST endpoint
When accessing public archives
Then the issue seems to be caused by retrieval, rather than upload

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- This error may have been introduced in autonomi 0.8.x library
- Example public archive at XOR dc790a3a5a1c942d102941ccea3407594eb716cb90d2a86c7079265e2b427bd2 (or via URL http://localhost:18888/dc790a3a5a1c942d102941ccea3407594eb716cb90d2a86c7079265e2b427bd2 or http://anttp.antsnest.site/dc790a3a5a1c942d102941ccea3407594eb716cb90d2a86c7079265e2b427bd2)
- This is the underlying error, when trying to deserialise PubilArchive data: `autonomi::files::PublicArchive::from_bytes(bytes)`: `InvalidMarkerRead(Error { kind: UnexpectedEof, message: "\\&#34;failed to fill whole buffer\\&#34;" })`
