As a technical writer
I want to break the main README.md into multiple, linked, documents with additional detail
So that it is easier to read about specific AntTP details, while still having a good high level summary

Given the README.md contains a lot of information in one document
When refactoring the document
Then break it down into different markdown files, containing different sections of information, linked from the primary document
And create chapters for background/overview, build/run, proxy/firefox/brave configuration, archive/tarchive, web app customisation/dev, and publish your website, pointer name resolver (PNR), MCP tools API, gRPC API, REST API / swagger UI, Roadmap
And store linked documents in /docs/*.md
And update/reword documents to improve flow or readability, but keep the tone professional and written as a third person perspective

Given more information than README.md is detailed within the code
When adding additional detail
Then add a sub-directory to /docs for each primary data type (e.g. pointers, chunks, registers, etc - see /src/controller/*.rs)
And create a sequence diagram for each of these primary data type flows (add, update, edit, delete, etc)
And refer to each endpoint that touches these data type flows (REST, MCP, gRCP) to show where similarities are

Given some of the existing README.md may be stale
When updating the documentation
Then check anttp_config.rs matches runtime options
And add links /test/* README.md files to allow readers to find them

Implementation Notes

- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Add navigation links at the bottom of each page to go 'up' to the parent and 'next' / 'previous' to step through sibling pages.
