As an application user
When I request a pointer, I want the command to be executed immediately, rather than being queued
So blockages on the queue do not slow down requests

Given the pointer caching client already has a pointer_get function which creates a command an adds it to the queue
When the pointer caching client is asked to get a pointer
Then execute the command immediately using tokio to spawn the command asynchronously
And continue to return the cached item where possible

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- use `tokio::spawn(async move {})` to spawn task
