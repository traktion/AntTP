As an archive API consumer
I want to be able to provide the unresolved name or address to the archive endpoints
So that I can easily interact with the archive endpoints without having to resolve the target address beforehand

Given the 'resolve_name' function in resolver_service.rs can accept any source name or address as an input and output the target address
When any public function in archive_service.rs is called with an 'address' argument
Then include ResolverService in the ArchiveService struct
And update code that instantiates ArchiveService to provide Resolver service as a dependency
And firstly call the 'resolve' function in resolver_service.rs and attempt to resolve the address
And use the resolved address, instead of the original address, for the rest of the function 

Implementation Notes

- Place any unit tests at the bottom of the same file as the associated production code
- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00001_issue_title.txt)
- Update unit tests to validate the changes
