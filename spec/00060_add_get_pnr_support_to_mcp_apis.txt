As an MCP tool API consumer
I want to be able to get PNRs
So that I can view the current state of the PNR zones

Given pnr_tool.rs handles MCP tool request for PNRs
When adding GET PNR support
Then update pnr_tool.rs to include a get_pnr_zone function
And use pointer_tool.rs as a reference
And apply #[tool] annotation to get_pnr_zone

Given pnr_service.rs implements get_pnr
When adding GET PNR support
Then call get_pnr in a similar way to pnr_controller.rs

Provide unit tests where applicable for new code.

Implementation Notes

- Increment patch version of anttp package in Cargo.toml
- Create a copy of this issue description and save to /spec using the name of this issue as the filename (with lower underscore case, starting with the 5 char padded issue number, e.g. 00060_issue_title.txt)
